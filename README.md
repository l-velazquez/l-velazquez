Hi there, I’m Luis! 

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a passionate software developer and researcher focused on combining data science with medical insights to create impactful solutions. My current work involves analyzing clinical laboratory data using machine learning techniques to find reference intervals, particularly within lipid panels and thyroid-related labs.

My Tech Stack:
- Languages: Python, JavaScript, SQL
- Frameworks: Django, React {working on that:}
- Data Science: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning: Gaussian Mixture Models, Clustering, Data Visualization
- DevOps: Docker, Git, Raspberry Pi server setups
- Other Tools: Jupyter Notebook, LED Matrix projects

What I’m Working On:
- Building a tool to find reference intervals in clinical data
- Exploring correlations between lipid panels and thyroid function using machine learning
- Developing web apps with React and Django
- Setting up Raspberry Pi as a home server for data storage and network management
- Creating data-driven projects around personal aesthetics and style classification

Fun Facts:
- I enjoy experimenting with single-board PCs and Raspberry Pi projects.
- I’m passionate about combining software development with data analysis.
- In my spare time, I love to work on personal web apps and tech projects.
